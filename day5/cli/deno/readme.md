# CLI 

There are some tools that help to build effective CLI (or TUI) tools.

- You can build these entirely yourself and not use third party tools
- You can use a 3rd party library to help build them: [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) are big in the space.
- These [guidelines are great](https://clig.dev/) if you want to think deeper about CLIs
- For testing, I'd suggest can using vitest for unit tests (or maybe Deno test)


- Here's a video course by me that might be helpful: https://egghead.io/lessons/node-js-parse-user-input-through-node-js-process-argv-for-flags
